\chapter{The Monastic Complex}

It seems that modern institutions and institutional attitudes are
related to the monastery as Freudian man is related to his mother
in the Oedipus complex. The person who openly enters a monastery is
frowned upon as a weakling who cannot face the world, as a psychopath
who seeks an institutional excuse for his solitary vices, or as an
irresponsible mystic who prefers to discharge his vital obligations
through otherworldly visions rather than through worldly deeds. These
attitudes are mirrored in the popular opinions that the monastery is
a vicious and corrupt institution, a romantic garden of moonlight and
fountains, or the typical and extreme example of fake asceticism. And
yet our reformers from the social settlement worker to the communist
commissar persistently and unconsciously revert to the monastic pattern
as the ideal and blueprint of their efforts. The school, the hospital,
the factory, and the model town continue the monastic theme, both by
mimicry and by protest. The social and cultural values that have lodged
in our consciences are monastic derivatives.

This is the clinical picture of a complex, it suggests an historical
perspective, and indicates a psychoanalytic cure through historical
and philosophical research. My attention was called to it by Lewis
Mumford's study of \emph{Technics and Civilization}. He there makes the
Benedictine monastery the vanishing point and origin of the industrial
revolution by calling attention to the fact that the mechanical clock
was invented by a Benedictine monk. The sailing vessel, the water-wheel,
and the windmill determine the major lines of the perspective, and
the later developments of the school, the hospital, the factory, and
the laboratory, are easy to place and fill in. The university and the
college fill the central foreground of the picture.
