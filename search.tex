\chapter{The Monastic Complex}

It seems that modern institutions and institutional attitudes are
related to the monastery as Freudian man is related to his mother
in the Oedipus complex. The person who openly enters a monastery is
frowned upon as a weakling who cannot face the world, as a psychopath
who seeks an institutional excuse for his solitary vices, or as an
irresponsible mystic who prefers to discharge his vital obligations
through otherworldly visions rather than through worldly deeds.
